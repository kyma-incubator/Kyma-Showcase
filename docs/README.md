# Docs

## Overview

The `docs` folder is solely dedicated to project documentation and follows the [content strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types) naming convention. 

Inside the `assets` directory are located all the diagrams and images related to the documentation.
